## About

I'm a software developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden. I mainly do backend work in C# and .NET with the occasional frontend bits in JavaScript or TypeScript with one of the major frameworks. I've been interested in computers since my dad first bought an IBM 386 PC when I six years old and programming has been with me in various forms almost since then.
